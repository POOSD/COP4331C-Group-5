What will the product do?
  It is a game, so the product will entertain an individual.
        
Why are you creating this particular product?
  As fans of the genre we decided to build a game that incorporates mechanics and gimmicks that
  aren’t in other games currently on the market.
        
Who will benefit from this product?
  Anyone who enjoys shoot-em-up sidescrollers will benefit from having a fresh take and a fun time.
        
How does the product compare against similar products already on the market?
  The game will have a health bar mechanic which encourages the player to balance risk versus reward
  as a benefit instead of just as a way to punish risky behavior.  The player will have to avoid
  damage to health or replenish health if drained. The game also provides a cyberpunk themed story
  and atmosphere, which riffs off of real world events to provide a relatable but driving story and
  experience.

Elevator Pitch:
    Our project entitled, “The Legend of Kaneko Ono (カネコ オノ)" is a game built for players of
    side scrolling shooter games who want a fresh take on their beloved genre with new mechanics.
    This leads to changing the way that players understand the genre of side scrolling shooters in
    that it can be more interactive than just avoiding the enemies and scoring points.  As fans of
    the genre we decided to build a game that incorporates mechanics and gimmicks that aren’t in other
    games currently on the market. Unlike games such as R-Type, Gradius, or Darius, our product offers
    a fresh and modern experience by encouraging more risk-reward strategic thinking than typical
    side-scrolling shooters, and adds unique complexities via “hacking” mechanics that still complement
    traditional side-scrolling mechanics.
