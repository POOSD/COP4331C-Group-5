Use this folder to store the documentation related to any and all administration tasks.
This includes any files explictly required for the project, as well as any documentation that will be graded, feedback from grading sessions, or provided documents.
Additionally any meeting notes or references that need to be seen by the evaluators should go here.


Be kind, but remember that if it isn't documented it never happened.
