Beginning of story:

Narrator appears on screen:

"Hello!"

[some (maybe funny) dialogue]

"I have a story to tell you of an old friend of mine."

"Would you like to just hear the plain old story, or do you want detail? ...Or do you want to *relive* the struggles of the legend themself?"

Plain old story refers to an easy mode
Detail is medium
and relive their struggles is hard mode
