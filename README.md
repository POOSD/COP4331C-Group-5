# The Legend of Kaneko Ono (カネコ オノ)

# Product Vision

"Our project entitled, “The Legend of Kaneko Ono (カネコ オノ)" is a game built for players of side scrolling shooter games who want a fresh take on their beloved genre with new mechanics. This leads to changing the way that players understand the genre of side scrolling shooters in that it can be more interactive than just avoiding the enemies and scoring points.  As fans of the genre we decided to build a game that incorporates mechanics and gimmicks that aren’t in other games currently on the market. Unlike games such as R-Type, Gradius, or Darius, our product offers a fresh and modern experience by encouraging more risk-reward strategic thinking than typical side-scrolling shooters, and adds unique complexities via “hacking” mechanics that still complement traditional side-scrolling mechanics."

# Sprint 1

Each item should link to the actual product, be it a google spreadsheet, google doc, github markdown file, etc. Do not link to a markdown file that contains only a link to another location - link directly from the appropriate item below. Failure to adhere to this criteria wil result in the associated artifact not being graded. Add any additional items required for the specific sprint submission.

**note**: For this sprint, I am anticipating that you will continue to work on the stories carried over from Sprint 1, with a focus on the design aspect of your system. I am expecting your architecture document and diagrams to reflect the system only in the context of these user stories, with some generalization to help plan for the other items currently in the backlog. I am not expecting a significant amount of implementation at this point, if any at all.

**note**: At this point I am expecting that you have designed out a few of the initial user stories and started to implement this. From this point forward there should be continuous integration and deployment, producing working software that is demoed at the end of each sprint.
