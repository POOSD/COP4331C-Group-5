# The Legend of Kaneko Ono (カネコ オノ)

# Product Vision

Our project entitled, “The Legend of Kaneko Ono (カネコ オノ)" is a cyberpunk-themed game, built for fans of side scrolling shooter games who want a fresh take on their beloved genre with new mechanics. This leads to changing the way that players experience the genre of side scrolling shooters in that it can be more interactive than just avoiding the enemies and scoring points.

As fans of the genre, we decided to build a game that incorporates mechanics and gimmicks that aren’t in other games currently on the market. Unlike games such as R-Type, Gradius, or Darius, our product offers a fresh and modern experience by encouraging more risk-reward strategic thinking than typical side-scrolling shooters, and adds unique complexities via “hacking” mechanics that still complement traditional side-scrolling mechanics."

Specifically, our game will feature an enemy type known as the "drones". They'll be smaller than normal ships. Each drone will be encompassed by a circular area; if the player sticks around in one of these areas, they'll start getting hacked, and if they stick around for too long, they'll have a piece of their ship disabled. First, their faster movement options, then their view of the hacking zone's perimeter will be blurred; then their shields will be weakened, and finally the player's firing functionality will be disabled. As counterplay to this mechanic, the player can leave a drone's zone to stop getting hacked.

# Sprint 1

Each item should link to the actual product, be it a google spreadsheet, google doc, github markdown file, etc. Do not link to a markdown file that contains only a link to another location - link directly from the appropriate item below. Failure to adhere to this criteria wil result in the associated artifact not being graded. Add any additional items required for the specific sprint submission.

## Task Allocation

Shir Nava - Helped with UML Diagrams, Updated Product Backlog md file and architecture md file, helped update trello board, Burndown chart and Velocity chart

Megan Diehl - Coordinated team on what's due by deadline, worked on UML diagrams, created user stories 010, 011, and 012, and made the background visual asset.

Daniel Trimble - Touched up demo assets, built the demo level, wrote tested and validated the player movement script, built system overview and container architectural diagrams, uploaded completed and validated demo video on YouTube channel, did miscellaneous github work, revised/updated/organized Trello, and created user story 009.

Jake DiClemente - Completed UI diagrams, aided with UML diagrams.

Thomas Smith - Updated/revised the Trello user stories to be more player-focused, and updated both backlogs and mostly redone the requirements on GitHub.

**note**: For this sprint, I am anticipating that you will continue to work on the stories carried over from Sprint 1, with a focus on the design aspect of your system. I am expecting your architecture document and diagrams to reflect the system only in the context of these user stories, with some generalization to help plan for the other items currently in the backlog. I am not expecting a significant amount of implementation at this point, if any at all.

Thomas Smith - Developed rudimentary object spawning behavior, expanded overly complex user stories, segmented validation criteria with Shir


**note**: At this point I am expecting that you have designed out a few of the initial user stories and started to implement this. From this point forward there should be continuous integration and deployment, producing working software that is demoed at the end of each sprint.
